# About this Book


This book is created as an attempt to consolidate my learnings as I prepare for Data Science related interviews. There is enormous amount of resources available in the internet, multiple repositories, there are even new companies that have cropped up helping students prepare for interviews at the Big Tech companies. The idea here is to create an accessible version of these resources so people on the same journey can benefit from it.

This book does not cover the topics in depth, it covers just enough to get you ready for the interview. The assumption here is that the person using it is already familiar with the topic and is here to brush up on the topic. Additonal resources for someone eager to explore the topic in depth will be added later.
