## Time Series Analysis

**Reference:** [ðŸ“–Explanation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_english/topic09_time_series/topic9_part1_time_series_python.ipynb)

A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.

- **Moving Average:** Here the assumption is that future value of our variable depends on the average of its $k$ previous values. Moving average has another use case - smoothing the original time series to identify trends. The wider the window, the smoother the trend. In the case of very noisy data, which is often encountered in finance, this procedure can help detect common patterns. This can also be used to determine anamolies based on the confidence level.

- **Weighted average:** It is a simple modification to the moving average. The weights sum up to `1` with larger weights assigned to more recent observations.
$\hat{y}_{t} = \displaystyle\sum^{k}_{n=1} \omega_n y_{t+1-n}$

- **Exponential smoothing:** Here instead of weighting the last $k$ values of the time series, we start weighting all available observations while exponentially decreasing the weights as we move further back in time.
$\hat{y}_{t} = \alpha \cdot y_t + (1-\alpha) \cdot \hat y_{t-1} $

	The $\alpha$ weight is called a smoothing factor. It defines how quickly we will "forget" the last available true observation. The smaller $\alpha$ is, the more influence the previous observations have and the smoother the series is.

- **Double Exponential smoothing:** Up to now, the methods that we've discussed have been for a single future point prediction (with some nice smoothing). That is cool, but it is also not enough. Let's extend exponential smoothing so that we can predict two future points (of course, we will also include more smoothing).

	Series decomposition will help us -- we obtain two components: intercept (i.e. level) $\ell$ and slope (i.e. trend) $b$. We have learnt to predict intercept (or expected series value) with our previous methods; now, we will apply the same exponential smoothing to the trend by assuming that the future direction of the time series changes depends on the previous weighted changes. As a result, we get the following set of functions:

	$$\ell_x = \alpha y_x + (1-\alpha)(\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$

	$$b_x = \beta(\ell_x - \ell_{x-1}) + (1-\beta)b_{x-1}$$

	$$\hat{y}_{x+1} = \ell_x + b_x$$

	The first one describes the intercept, which, as before, depends on the current value of the series. The second term is now split into previous values of the level and of the trend. The second function describes the trend, which depends on the level changes at the current step and on the previous value of the trend. In this case, the $\beta$ coefficient is a weight for exponential smoothing. The final prediction is the sum of the model values of the intercept and trend.

- **Triple exponential smoothing a.k.a. Holt-Winters:**

	The idea is to add a third component - seasonality. This means that we should not use this method if our time series is not expected to have seasonality. Seasonal components in the model will explain repeated variations around intercept and trend, and it will be specified by the length of the season, in other words by the period after which the variations repeat. For each observation in the season, there is a separate component; for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.

	The new system of equations:

	$$\ell_x = \alpha(y_x - s_{x-L}) + (1-\alpha)(\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$

	$$b_x = \beta(\ell_x - \ell_{x-1}) + (1-\beta)b_{x-1}$$

	$$s_x = \gamma(y_x - \ell_x) + (1-\gamma)s_{x-L}$$

	$$\hat{y}_{x+m} = \ell_x + mb_x + s_{x-L+1+(m-1)modL}$$

	The intercept now depends on the current value of the series minus any corresponding seasonal component. Trend remains unchanged, and the seasonal component depends on the current value of the series minus the intercept and on the previous value of the component. Take into account that the component is smoothed through all the available seasons; for example, if we have a Monday component, then it will only be averaged with other Mondays. You can read more on how averaging works and how the initial approximation of the trend and seasonal components is done [here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc435.htm). Now that we have the seasonal component, we can predict not just one or two steps ahead but an arbitrary $m$ future steps ahead, which is very encouraging.

	Below is the code for a triple exponential smoothing model, which is also known by the last names of its creators, Charles Holt and his student Peter Winters. Additionally, the Brutlag method was included in the model to produce confidence intervals:

	$$\hat y_{max_x}=\ell_{xâˆ’1}+b_{xâˆ’1}+s_{xâˆ’T}+mâ‹…d_{tâˆ’T}$$

	$$\hat y_{min_x}=\ell_{xâˆ’1}+b_{xâˆ’1}+s_{xâˆ’T}-mâ‹…d_{tâˆ’T}$$

	$$d_t=\gammaâˆ£y_tâˆ’\hat y_tâˆ£+(1âˆ’\gamma)d_{tâˆ’T},$$

	where $T$ is the length of the season, $d$ is the predicted deviation. Other parameters were taken from triple exponential smoothing. You can read more about the method and its applicability to anomaly detection in time series [here](http://fedcsis.org/proceedings/2012/pliks/118.pdf).

	Exponentiality is hidden in the recursiveness of the function â€“ we multiply by $(1-\alpha)$ each time, which already contains a multiplication by $(1-\alpha)$ of previous model values.



#### Metrics

- **R squared:** coefficient of determination (in econometrics, this can be interpreted as the percentage of variance explained by the model), $(-\infty, 1]$

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ 

- **Mean Absolute Error:** this is an interpretable metric because it has the same unit of measurment as the initial series, $[0, +\infty)$

$MAE = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|}{n}$ 

- **Median Absolute Error:** again, an interpretable metric that is particularly interesting because it is robust to outliers, $[0, +\infty)$

$MedAE = median(|y_1 - \hat{y}_1|, ... , |y_n - \hat{y}_n|)$

- **Mean Squared Error:** the most commonly used metric that gives a higher penalty to large errors and vice versa, $[0, +\infty)$

$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$

- **Mean Squared Logarithmic Error:** practically, this is the same as MSE, but we take the logarithm of the series. As a result, we give more weight to small mistakes as well. This is usually used when the data has exponential trends, $[0, +\infty)$

$MSLE = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (log(1+y_i) - log(1+\hat{y}_i))^2$

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error:** this is the same as MAE but is computed as a percentage, which is very convenient when you want to explain the quality of the model to management, $[0, +\infty)$

$MAPE = \frac{100}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|y_i - \hat{y}_i|}{y_i}$
